# Checkpoint – Batch 10  

## Added in this batch  
- `app/resources/page.tsx` – Resources index page linking to knowledge base, tools, API reference, and policy templates subpages.  
- `app/resources/knowledge-base/page.tsx` – Knowledge base page listing topics such as incident response, security policies, and vulnerability management.  

## What's next  
Proceed to complete Batch 10:  
- Build the remaining Resources subpages: tools (download links & checksums), API reference (rendering OpenAPI spec), and policy templates (downloadable docs).  
- Ensure each subpage includes original content and appropriate components for the resources domain.  
- After completing the Resources section, update `CHECKPOINT.md` accordingly.
